        The useRef hook in React is a versatile tool that allows developers to
        access and interact with elements directly, especially in the context of
        the Document Object Model (DOM). Unlike state-related hooks, such as
        useState, useRef does not trigger re-renders when its value changes,
        making it suitable for holding mutable values that need to persist
        between renders without impacting the component's rendering cycle. One
        primary use case for useRef is its application in working with the DOM,
        enabling direct manipulation of underlying elements by creating a
        reference and attaching it using the ref attribute. This is particularly
        useful for tasks like focusing on input fields or measuring element
        dimensions. Additionally, useRef is commonly employed to persist values
        across renders, allowing developers to store and access previous state
        or props without triggering unnecessary re-renders. Its simplicity and
        effectiveness make it an essential tool in React for scenarios where
        direct interaction with the DOM or maintaining mutable values across
        renders is required. The useRef hook in React is a versatile and
        powerful tool that provides a way to access and interact with a React
        element directly. Unlike the useState hook, useRef doesn't cause
        re-rendering when its value changes. Instead, it persists across renders
        and can be used to hold mutable values that don't trigger a re-render.
        The primary use case for useRef is to obtain references to DOM elements
        or to persist values between renders without triggering a component
        re-render. One of the common use cases for useRef is interacting with
        the DOM. When you create a ref using useRef, it can be attached to a
        React element with the ref attribute. This allows you to access and
        manipulate the underlying DOM node directly, which can be useful for
        tasks like focusing on an input field, measuring the size of an element,
        or triggering imperative animations. Another noteworthy application of
        useRef is its ability to persist values between renders without causing
        re-renders. This is particularly useful when you need to store values
        that might change but don't require re-rendering the component. For
        instance, you can use useRef to keep track of the previous state or
        props, allowing you to compare them in the useEffect hook without
        triggering unnecessary renders. The useRef hook in React is a versatile
