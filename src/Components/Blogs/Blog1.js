      <h1>Purpose of React Router</h1>
      <br />
      <p>
        Client side routing is required to keep your application in sync with
        the browser URL. It is mainly useful for Single Page Applications where
        the backend will be used for RESTful API calls via XHR or AJAX calls.
        Being a SPA uses can book mark your URL and when they hit the URL again
        , your application should load that page with the data and its state.
        The main difference between Server side routing and client side routing:
        1. In Server Side routing you download(serve) the entire page. 2. In
        client Side routing along with the entire page, you can serve a specific
        portion of a page, reuse the DOM, manually manage the URL and history
        states. eg. www.something.com/page1/tab1 will show tab1 in the UI
        www.something.com/page1.tab2 will show tab2 in the UI In this way the
        url can get more complex and you can have sub-routes with states. Those
        who need a client-side router, need it for state management. Say you
        have server-rendered pages, but with some client-side widgets - e.g. a
        calendar, set of filters or collapsed or open sidebar. Router helps you
        initialize these components of the page in the exact state you want
        them. Granted, you could do most of it and all of the use cases I've
        named on the server, too. But it's usually a lot easier to handle these
        on the client. You might render it faster on the server, but sometimes,
        especially when doing partial page updates, it's cheaper and faster to
        handle that client-side. React Router serves as a crucial navigation
        tool in React applications, enabling the creation of sophisticated,
        dynamic user interfaces without the need for full-page reloads. Its
        primary purpose lies in the facilitation of single-page applications
        (SPAs), where seamless content updates occur as users navigate through
        different sections of the application. One of its key features is the
        provision of declarative routing, allowing developers to articulate the
        UI's structure in a clear and understandable manner, closely mirroring
        the component hierarchy. React Router supports nested routing, enabling
        the construction of complex user interfaces with multiple levels of
        navigation. It also excels in dynamic routing scenarios, permitting the
        passing of parameters through the URL to adapt components based on
        varying data. The library effectively manages browser history, ensuring
        smooth integration with the back and forward buttons, and offers
        different navigation types, such as push, replace, and go back.
        Furthermore, React Router seamlessly integrates with React's
        component-based architecture, allowing developers to associate each
        route with a React component, resulting in an organized and maintainable
        codebase. In essence, React Router significantly enhances the
        development of responsive, well-structured applications by providing a
        comprehensive and flexible solution for managing navigation in
        React-based projects. React Router plays a pivotal role in shaping the
        navigation and user experience of React applications, particularly in
        the context of building single-page applications (SPAs). At its core,
        React Router provides a robust framework for handling dynamic content
        updates as users navigate between different sections of an application,
        all without the cumbersome need for full-page reloads. Its defining
        characteristic is the promotion of declarative routing, allowing
        developers to articulate the application's UI structure in a clear and
        concise manner, closely aligned with the hierarchical arrangement of
        React components. This declarative approach not only enhances code
        readability but also contributes to the maintainability of the overall
        codebase. One of the standout features of React Router is its support
        for nested routing, which proves invaluable when dealing with complex
        user interfaces that require multiple levels of navigation. This nested
        routing capability enables developers to organize and structure their
        applications in a way that mirrors the logical flow of the user journey.
        Furthermore, React Router excels in dynamic routing scenarios, providing
        a mechanism for passing parameters through the URL. This flexibility
        allows developers to create adaptable and reusable components that can
        respond dynamically to varying data, thereby enhancing the overall
        versatility of the application. In terms of user interaction and history
        management, React Router seamlessly integrates with the browser's
        navigation features. Users can fluidly navigate back and forth through
        the application using the browser's buttons, maintaining a cohesive and
        intuitive user experience. The library also offers different types of
        navigation, such as push, replace, and go back, giving developers the
        tools needed to control and manipulate the navigation flow according to
        specific requirements. Crucially, React Router aligns harmoniously with
        React's component-based architecture, reinforcing the framework's
        philosophy of building UIs as a composition of reusable components. Each
        route within React Router can be associated with a specific React
        component, fostering a modular and organized development approach. This
        association not only simplifies the development process but also
        contributes to the scalability and extensibility of the application. In
        summary, React Router emerges as a cornerstone in the development of
        modern, responsive, and dynamic web applications. Its ability to
        seamlessly manage navigation, support nested routing, and integrate
        effectively with React components makes it an indispensable tool for
        developers seeking to create sophisticated SPAs with a focus on user
        experience and code maintainability.
